### Personal Projects

<span class='paper-title'>ConnectFourRL [[code]](https://www.github.com/1yian/ConnectFourRL)</span>\
I developed an off-policy actor critic algorithm for the game of ConnectFour, which was later enhanced with Monte-Carlo Tree Search to enable better decision-making through strategic planning. By playing against itself, the algorithm continually improved its performance. Using my implementation, players can test their skills against the AI and observe its capabilities in various situations.

<span class='paper-title'>Reinforcement Learning in SuperTuxKart [[paper]](/files/supertuxkart.pdf)</span>\
Our team implemented asynchronous actor critic for the game of SuperTuxKart and identified its sample inefficiency. To address this issue, we proposed an imitation learning framework based on DAgger, demonstrating the ability to accurately imitate expert behavior. Additionally, we explored methods for extrapolating beyond the performance of the expert agent."

<span class='paper-title'>MuZero in MuJoCo [[paper]](/files/muzero_mujoco.pdf)</span>\
Our team implemented [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf) and applied it to the problem of robot locomotion, highlighting the complexity of this control task and the limitations of model-based RL in this domain. We also proposed potential solutions to enable MuZero to generalize to continuous control tasks in this domain.

<span class='paper-title'>TwitchMoji [[paper]](/files/twitchmoji.pdf)</span>\
TwitchMoji is a machine learning tool that predicts the emojis to be used in Twitch chat messages. By fine-tuning a language model, we can accurately detect the sentiment of any text and express it through Twitch emojis. This allows TwitchMoji to provide insight into the sentiment of Twitch chat messages and serve as a useful tool for understanding them.
