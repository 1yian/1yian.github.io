### Personal Projects

<span class='paper-title'>ConnectFourRL [[code]](https://www.github.com/1yian/ConnectFourRL)</span>\
I implemented the off-policy actor critic for the game of ConnectFour. I later combined the model with Monte-Carlo Tree Search to allow it to make better decisions by looking ahead. The algorithm was able improve its performance over time by playing against itself. My implementation allows players to compete against the AI and see how it performs in different scenarios.

<span class='paper-title'>Reinforcement Learning in SuperTuxKart [[paper]](/files/supertuxkart.pdf)</span>\
We implement asynchronous actor critic for SuperTuxKart. We discuss the sample inefficiency for SuperTuxKart, and later suggest an imitation learning framework based on [DAgger](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2011/4/Ross-AISTATS11-NoRegret.pdf). We show that we can accurately mimic expert behavior and suggest methods to extrapolate to performance beyond the expert agent.

<span class='paper-title'>TwitchMoji [[paper]](/files/twitchmoji.pdf)</span> 
TwitchMoji is a personal project that uses machine learning to predict the emojis used in [Twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)) chat messages. By fine-tuning a language model, we can accurately detect the sentiment of any given text and provide a unique way of expressing it in the form of Twitch emojis. This makes TwitchMoji a valuable tool for understanding the sentiment of Twitch chat messages.
