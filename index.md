Hi there! My name is Yian Wong, and I am a Master's student in computer science at [UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). I'm a passionate machine learning student, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow within this field.

Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the [Good Systems Initiative](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/projects/designing-responsible-ai-technologies-to-curb-disinformation), helping build white-box natural language processing models to curb disinformation.

I have also had the opportunity to intern at different companies, where I applied my machine learning skills to various projects. At [Terra Cover](http://www.terracover.ai/), I created a Bayesian probabilistic model for predicting flooding events. At [WiSilica](https://wisilica.com/), I created a computer vision object detector to detect people in real-time to save energy on office lighting.

In addition to my work experience, I have also published papers in the field of machine learning, including at [ARMA](https://armarocks.org/) and [ISGSR](https://isgsr2022.org/). My research interests include reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

In my free time, I enjoy playing games like League of Legends and chess. I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and develop my skills in the field of machine learning, and I am excited to see what new challenges and opportunities lie ahead.
