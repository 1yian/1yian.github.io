Welcome! I'm Yian Wong, a Master's student in computer science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). As a fervent machine learning enthusiast, I constantly seek out new ways to learn, grow, and challenge myself in this exciting field.

Currently, I work as a research assistant at the [Good Systems Initiative](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/projects/designing-responsible-ai-technologies-to-curb-disinformation), where I help build revolutionary white-box natural language processing models that combat disinformation. I've also had the privilege of interning at various companies and using my machine learning skills to tackle a range of projects. At [Terra Cover](http://www.terracover.ai/), I developed a Bayesian probabilistic model that accurately predicts flooding events. And at [WiSilica](https://wisilica.com/), I created a real-time computer vision object detector that reduces energy consumption by detecting people in the office.

In addition to my professional experience, I've also published papers on machine learning in esteemed journals such as [ARMA](https://armarocks.org/) and [ISGSR](https://isgsr2022.org/). My research interests include reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing games like League of Legends and chess, and always looking for ways to broaden my knowledge and hone my skills in machine learning. I can't wait to see what exciting opportunities and challenges lie ahead!
